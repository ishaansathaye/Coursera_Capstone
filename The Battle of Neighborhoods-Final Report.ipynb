    "\n",
    "**1.1 Scenario and Background**\n",
    "With the pandemic currently happening many populous cities are becoming prone to increasing numbers of cases. This is why Toronto and New York are becoming very dense with the number of cases. \n",
    "These cities are major places for tourism but with that stop the effect on the city is very drastic with businesses being the only thing that can go on with more restrictions on them as the cases nnumber goes up. Choosing two cities taht are pretty close together but also in different countries will give people a basic understanding of rules in both of these places and people are coping with the virus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzing the data of the most visited business places and venues will give an understanding of how the virus has effected these two populous cities. In doing so, the effect can show people that businesses located in certain areas are more prone to getting diseases and so it will tell more people to not go in that area or even tell people who want to open up a shop to choose carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.2 Problem to be resolved**\n",
    "Coronavirus has impacted many businesses especially because of how people are not allowed to go outside, and because of that the cities have been impacted the most. Doing analysis on this will make sure that places are scouted properly of the common places and places that dont have good reviews as of Foursquare.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.3 Interested Audience**\n",
    "The objective is to locate and recommend places during the quaranitne of places to go and places to avoid.\n",
    "\n",
    "This would interest anybody at this point due to the fact that the pandemic has changed everybody's lives and ultimately changed our lifestyle. The objective is to locate and recommend places during the quaranitne of places to go and places to avoid.\n",

    "\n",
    "2.1 Data Requirements\n",
    "Two places will be analysed in this project : ***Newyork City*** and **Toronto**. \n",
    "We will be using the below datasets for analysing Newyork city\n",
    "\n",
    "***Data 1 :*** \n",
    "Neighborhood has a total of 5 boroughs and 306 neighborhoods. In order to segement the neighborhoods and explore them, we will essentially need a dataset that contains the 5 boroughs and the neighborhoods that exist in each borough as well as the the latitude and logitude coordinates of each neighborhood. The dataset is of the borroughs and neighborhoods in New York***Data 1 :*** \n",

    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The Strategy to find the answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "The strategy is based on mapping the described data in section 2.0, in order to\n",
    "facilitate the choice of at least two candidate places for rent. The information will be\n",
    "consolidated in ONE MAP where one can see the details of the apartment, the cluster\n",
    "of venues in the neighborhood and the relative location from a subway station and\n",
    "from work place.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Tools:\n",
    "Web-scraping of sites is used to consolidate data-frame information which was\n",
    "saved as csv files for convenience and to simply the report.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maps with popups labels allow quick identification of location,price and feature, thus making the selection very easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Execution and Results\n",

    "**Venues and neighborhoods**\n",

    "\n",
    "**Conclusions**\n",
    "\n",
    "• I believe that this is impotant as with the virus impacting many people it is important for people to be on the lookout for places that have high denisty of cases\n",
    "\n",
    "• The mapping with the geopy has been very helpful in making sure to visualize the places and businesses that have been impacted the most by the pandemic\n"
